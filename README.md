# Generate Avatar Icon

This is a test about how to export a file (_.jpg/.png_) using **Canvas**. I tried to replicate those avatars that uses the first letter of firstname and lastname.

Example:

_Fernando Gomes = FM_

You can pick the text color and background color. You also can choose a extension to export: _JPG | PNG_
